<li>On March 9, an Explorer petroleum products pipeline failed in <a href="/wiki/Greenville,_Texas" title="Greenville, Texas">Greenville, Texas</a>. The 28-inch pipeline ruptured and released 13,436 barrels (2,136.2&#160;m<sup>3</sup>) of gasoline. The released gasoline eventually reached East Caddo Creek. The banks of the tributary and creek contained the escaping gasoline as it flowed away from the ruptured pipe. The probable cause of the pipeline failure was corrosion-fatigue cracking that initiated at the edge of the longitudinal seam weld at a likely preexisting weld defect. Contributing to the failure was the loss of pipe coating integrity.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></li>
<li>On April 7, a pipeline released fuel oil at Chalk Point near <a href="/wiki/Aquasco,_Maryland" title="Aquasco, Maryland">Aquasco, Maryland</a>.

The release was not discovered and addressed by the contract operating company, Support Terminal Services, Inc., until the late afternoon. Approximately 140,400 US gallons (531,000&#160;L) of fuel oil were released into the surrounding wetlands and Swanson Creek and, subsequently, the <a href="/wiki/Patuxent_River" title="Patuxent River">Patuxent River</a> as a result of the accident. No injuries were caused by the accident, which cost approximately $71&#160;million for environmental response and clean-up operations.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup></li>
<li>On May 19, a <a href="/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline" title="Colonial Pipeline">Colonial Pipeline</a> Co. line failed near <a href="/wiki/Greensboro,_North_Carolina" title="Greensboro, North Carolina">Greensboro, North Carolina</a>. At least 714 gallons (17 barrels) of kerosene spilled, some of which entered a pond that flows into a tributary of the East Fork Deep River. The kerosene spill caused a sheen about 40 feet by 40 feet in the pond. As a result of this, and six other previous <a href="/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline" title="Colonial Pipeline">Colonial Pipeline</a> accidents, the EPA fined Colonial $34&#160;million in 2003.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup></li>
<li>On June 7, a stopple fitting weld failed on a Wolverine Pipeline Company line, causing a rupture releasing 75,000 US gallons (280,000&#160;L) of gasoline into the environment, and causing the evacuation of more than 500 houses in <a href="/wiki/Blackman_Charter_Township,_Michigan" title="Blackman Charter Township, Michigan">Blackman Charter Township, Michigan</a>. The failure caused the shutdown of 30% of Michigan's gasoline supplies for nine days, contaminated a creek which flows into the Grand River, and a railroad track near the failure site was shut down for a week. Later tests found 715 anomalies in this pipeline. Wolverine later agreed to pay for switching houses in the area from local water wells to a city water source.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup></li>

The force of the escaping gas created a 51-foot (16&#160;m)-wide crater about 113 feet (34&#160;m) along the pipe. A 49-foot (15&#160;m) section of the pipe was ejected from the crater, in three pieces measuring approximately 3 feet (0.91&#160;m), 20 feet (6.1&#160;m), and 26 feet (7.9&#160;m) in length. The largest piece of pipe was found about 287 feet (87&#160;m) northwest of the crater. The cause of the failure was determined to be severe internal corrosion of that pipeline. On July 26, 2007, a USDOJ Consent Decree was later entered into by the pipeline owner to perform pipeline system upgrades to allow better internal pipeline inspections.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup></li>

In this incident, the pipe was a 6-inch gas pipeline. The crew was digging a hole with an auger for a noise-wall support, when it hit the underground pipe less than 500 meters from the previous day's incident.</li>
<li>On September 7, a bulldozer ruptured a 12-inch diameter NGL pipeline on State Route 36 south of <a href="/wiki/Abilene,_Texas" title="Abilene, Texas">Abilene, Texas</a>. An Abilene police detective, with 21 years of service, was severely burned when the vapors ignited, and he later died. Nearby, a woman saved herself by going underwater in her swimming pool. Her house was destroyed by the explosion and fire. The owner of the pipeline, ExxonMobil, was later fined by the Texas Railroad Commission for the pipeline not being marked.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup></li>
